# Pilot

The intent of this project is to educate builders about the purpose and usage of different AWS services in a complex application by demonstrating service implementation with AWS SDK.

## How to use this repository ?

Every branch provides 2 different implementations of the same application, in 2 folders.

1. before - Source code demonstrates implementation without using any AWS service
2. after - Source code demonstrates implementation with relevant AWS service integration
