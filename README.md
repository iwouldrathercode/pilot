# Pilot

The intent of this project is to educate builders about the purpose and usage of different AWS services in a complex application by demonstrating service implementation with AWS SDK.

## How to use this repository ?

Every branch provides 2 different implementations of the same application, in 2 folders.

1. `initial_implementation` - Source code demonstrates implementation either by provisioning an AWS resource manually / incorrect implementaion of an AWS service
2. `revised_implementation` - Source code demonstrates implementation with relevant AWS service integration
